## General Usage

### My moderators can't use Reindeer's commands!

On desktop, go to your Server Settings Integrations, and under Bots & Apps select Reindeer. You can then fine-tune every
command's permissions.

### How do I setup Reindeer for use?

Run the guided setup using `/setup` in your server.

### How do I configure Reindeer after I use `/setup`?

You can use the `/config` command to configure Reindeer after setup.

### How can I reset Reindeer?

Use the `/config reset` command to reset all data associated with the server, including existing reports.

## Philosophy & Features

### Why not just use a ticketing bot?

Ticketing bots usually requires more overhead and is not as simple as right-clicking on a message or user. Plus, the
user will be added to a channel which complicates things further. We believe that reporting should be made simple for
your members and shouldn't interrupt their conversations.

### Why not just DM a mod?

When sending a DM to a moderator, you are only allowing one mod to deal with it, until escalating the report themselves
when they're online. With Reindeer, a report instantly gets sent to all moderators and they can coordinate together for
the best resolution.

### Why not just ping a mod or a Mod role?

This will reveal your identity to the target, and while that doesn't always matter, reports are better left private.
They disrupt the current conversation and allows the target to harass you until the mods deal with them.

### Why do I need a whole thread for a report?

If a report is simple, you can simply ban them and approve & close the report. This makes searching for old reports
easier and having other staff members look over what you did. Of course, some reports aren't this simple and requires
discussion between the staff team.

## Misc Commands

### How can I invite the bot?

Click on the bot's profile and select 'Add to Server', or use `/invite`.

### How do I see the ping of the bot?

Use `/ping`.

## Development & Technical Bits

### Is Reindeer open-source?

Yes! You can see the source code and contribute to Reindeer over on [GitHub](https://github.com/GodderE2D/Reindeer).

### What language/library does Reindeer use?

Reindeer is built on TypeScript and discord.js.

### Where is Reindeer hosted?

Reindeer is hosted in Ashburn, Virginia (`us-ashburn-1`) on Oracle Cloud.

## Roadmap

### Will Reindeer ever offer a moderation suite as a complement to the reporting system?

Reindeer will probably never offer a moderation suite as many other moderation bots will likely do it better than us.
But miracles do happen!

### Will Reindeer receive premium features soon?

Maybe, but we aim that all current core features will remain free to use completely.

### How can I support Reindeer?

I'm glad you asked!
